Aim of Smart energy:
The aim of smart energy use cases in machine learning is to optimize energy consumption, increase efficiency, and reduce costs through the application of advanced data analytics and predictive modeling. 

machine learning model:
IN smart energy,i have to create three machine learning model
  1)prediction of energy consumption(Regression)
  2)anomaly detection of energy consumption(contextual anomaly)
  3)prediction of Energy Leakage(classification 0 and 1)

1)prediction of Energy consumption:
  The aim of creating the machine learning model for predicting energy consumption on hourly basis is to know future energy demand that a community or area required.for predicting the energy consumption of community, i have created dataset which consist of following features.

    1)Input Feature
        1)building_id-Building unique id of 1 to 9
        2)Building_category-category of building used
        3)apparent_temperature-apparent temperature of each hour in a location
        4)Dew_point_temperature-Dew point temperature of each hour in a location.
        5)Relative_humidity-Relative Humidity of each hour in a location(0-100%)
        6)Wind_speed-Wind Speed of each hour in a location
        7)Wind_direction-Wind direction of each hour in a location(0-360)
        8)day-day from extracted timestamp
        9)month-month from extracted timestamp
        10)hour-hour from extracted timestamp
        11)is_weekend-weekend or not weekday from extracted timestamp
        12)is_holiday-holiday or not from extracted timestamp
        13)season-season(Autumn,summer,winter,spring)
        14)weekday-day of week(monday,tuesday,wednesday,etc)

    2)Output Features:
        15)Energy consumption

2)Time series anomaly detection of energy consumption:
  TheTIme series anomaly detection of energy consumption is normaly detecting a very high or low energy consumption than a normal energy consumption.this model is useful for detecting anomaly and to optimise the energy consumption.here i have used contextual anomaly detection technique to solve the anomaly in energy consumption by taking following Features

    1)Input Feature
        1)building_id-Building unique id of 1 to 9
        2)Building_category-category of building used
        3)apparent_temperature-apparent temperature of each hour in a location
        4)Dew_point_temperature-Dew point temperature of each hour in a location.
        5)Relative_humidity-Relative Humidity of each hour in a location(0-100%)
        6)Wind_speed-Wind Speed of each hour in a location
        7)Wind_direction-Wind direction of each hour in a location(0-360)
        8)day-day from extracted timestamp
        9)month-month from extracted timestamp
        10)hour-hour from extracted timestamp
        11)is_weekend-weekend or not weekday from extracted timestamp
        12)is_holiday-holiday or not from extracted timestamp
        13)season-season(Autumn,summer,winter,spring)
        14)weekday-day of week(monday,tuesday,wednesday,etc)
        15)Energy consumption


    2)Output Features:
        15)anomaly(0 or 1)

3)prediction of Energy Leakage(classification 0 and 1):
lastmodel,we have created TIme series anomaly model with in the building,here we are going to create prediction machine learning model of having a energy leakage between Bulk meter consumption and building meter consumption

     Energy Leakage=Total Energy Recorded by Bulk Meterâˆ’Total Energy Recorded by Energy Consumption Meter

THe above formula reciprocates a energy leakage that energy flow from bulk meter to energy consumption meter.here i in my model first seven building id has been comes under 1 bulk meter so i am taking 7 unique building id and bulk meter to find energy leakage.

     1)Input Feature
        1)1_building
        2)2_building
        3)3_building
        4)4_building
        5)5_building
        6)6_building     
        7)7_building
        8)bulk_consumption

    2)Output Features:
        15)energy leakage(0 or 1)
